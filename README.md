# fritzbox_blacklists

I believe that telemarketing in germany is a disgusting business and that many people have been pulled over the table by fraudulent calls. 

Already a single call, which disturbs me in my spare time, is a disturbing violation of my private sphere. 

So, this is my own german telephone number blacklist collection directly exported from fritz.box with FRITZ!OS:06.XX

It is a private list of telephone numbers I collected in several years with several fritz.boxes.

I cannot guarantee the accuracy of this list and whether these telephone numbers still exist.

Use at your own responsibility.
