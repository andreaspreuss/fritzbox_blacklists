# fritzbox_blacklists

I believe that telemarketing in germany is a disgusting business and that many people have been 
pulled over the table by fraudulent calls. In the process, individuals - often on behalf of companies - contact users to negotiate new contracts. Sometimes it is also about winning games, in other cases users should be lured into cost traps.

Already a single call, which disturbs me in my spare time, is a disturbing violation of my private sphere. 

Whether calls to competitions or the purchase of dog food - the misuse of telephone numbers and unauthorised advertising calls are prohibited. But that does not stop dubious companies from doing so. And they are getting bolder and bolder. For this reason I reject telemarketing completely.

So, this is my own german telephone number blacklist collection directly exported from fritz.box with FRITZ!OS:06.XX
It is a private list of telephone numbers I collected in several years with several fritz.boxes.
I cannot guarantee the accuracy of this list and whether these telephone numbers still exist.

Use at your own fun & responsibility.
